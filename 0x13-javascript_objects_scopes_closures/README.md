2. File: 1-rectangle.js - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
- You must use the class notation for defining your class
- The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
- Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
- Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

3. File: 2-rectangle.js - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
- You must use the class notation for defining your class
- The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h

- Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

6. File: 5-square.js - Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:
- You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
- The constructor must take 1 argument: size

7. File: 6-square.js - Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:
- You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
- Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
- If c is undefined, use the character X

8. File: 7-occurrences.js - Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list:
9. File: 8-esrever.js - Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list:
